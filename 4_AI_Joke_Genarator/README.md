# AI Programming Joke Generator

A simple web application that generates programming-related jokes using the [JokeAPI](https://jokeapi.dev/). The jokes are displayed in a stylish UI with animations, and a loading spinner indicates when a joke is being fetched.

## Features
- Fetches programming-related jokes from the JokeAPI
- Displays single-line and two-part jokes dynamically
- Includes a loading spinner while fetching jokes
- Animations for joke display
- Simple, clean, and responsive design

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Fetch API)
